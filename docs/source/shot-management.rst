Shot Management
===============

The primary purpose of BLACS is to execute experiment shots on the lab
apparatus. BLACS does not own a queue. Runmanager owns the authoritative shot
queue and offers shots to BLACS one at a time, over ZMQ, when BLACS asks for
one. Runmanager is also responsible for forwarding completed shots on to lyse.

Before running any shot, BLACS compares the shot's connection table with the
laboratory connection table and verifies that the shot is compatible with the
current hardware configuration. Compatibility requires the shot connection
table to be a subset of the lab connection table. This ensures that old
experiments cannot be run on hardware that is no longer configured to match,
preventing damage or unexpected results.

The BLACS shot-execution controls are a **Request shots** button, an **Abort**
button, a status display naming the running shot, a local override shot
selector, and an indicator showing whether runmanager is responding.

The queue itself lives in runmanager, on its Queue tab, along with the settings
governing how queued shots are compiled, whether the queue is paused, and what
BLACS is given when the queue is empty. Queued shots are deleted there with the
Delete or Backspace key or the row context menu, rather than with a button.
Replacement submissions clear waiting work while preserving every row already
sent to BLACS. There is no reordering control and no repeat control: both
belonged to the BLACS-owned
queue and did not survive the move to runmanager. Anyone arriving from the
upstream documentation will go looking for them.

Synchronising with runmanager
-----------------------------

Because the queue and the hardware live in different processes, a shot can be
lost or run twice if the two disagree about who is holding it. The rules below
are what prevent that. They are stated here because neither side can be read
from the other's source, and changing one half without the other reintroduces
exactly the failures they exist to close.

**Each application owns what it alone can decide.** Runmanager owns the queue:
its contents and order, whether it is paused, which shot is offered next, what
becomes of a shot that did not run, and submitting completed shots to lyse.
BLACS owns the apparatus: whether it is requesting shots at all, aborting the
shot in progress, the error state that stopped it, and its local override shot.
Neither reaches across. Runmanager cannot enable BLACS, clear its error,
restart a device or abort a shot; BLACS cannot pause, reorder or delete
anything in the queue. This is not merely tidiness — one BLACS is meant to
serve several runmanagers eventually, and a runmanager that could stop the
apparatus would be stopping everyone's work, not just its own.

**One exchange carries everything, and the outcome is applied first.** BLACS
makes a single call, ``queue_exchange(outcome, request_shot)``: it reports how
the shot it was last offered turned out, and asks for another, in one message.
Runmanager applies the outcome *before* it chooses what to offer, so one
exchange can retire the finished row and hand over the next one. There is no
separate acceptance handshake, because nothing leaves the queue when a shot is
offered: the row stays where it is, marked running, so a reply that goes
missing costs a poll rather than a shot.

That ordering is not an implementation detail. It is what makes the reclaim
below sound: by the time runmanager looks at the head of its queue, a row BLACS
has just reported on has already been retired or turned red, so anything still
marked running is a row this BLACS is demonstrably not executing.

**A shot_id names a queue row, not an attempt at it.** Every queued shot is
given one stable identifier when its record is made, and keeps it for the life
of the row — across a save and restore, and across every retry. Outcomes are
keyed on that identifier rather than on a filepath, which is what lets BLACS
report on a shot it re-ran under a fresh filename, and what lets runmanager
offer the same row again after a failure without matching filenames. Enqueuing
the same filepath again later makes a new row with a new identifier.

**A shot file BLACS re-runs is a copy, and the copy is the same shot.** A
shot file that already holds data is never run again in place: BLACS copies
it to a fresh numbered ``_repXXXXX.h5``, without the data of the run already
there, and runs the copy. Every root attribute the shot file carried crosses
over untouched, ``shot_id`` among them, because it is the same shot — BLACS
does not interpret those attributes and could put nothing in the place of one
it dropped. What it writes itself is ``run repeat``, the number of the copy,
and that is the field which tells the files of one shot apart. So a root
attribute naming a shot names the shot and not the file: anything
accumulating or averaging over results has to read the repeat number as well,
or it counts one shot more than once. Returning a failed shot to its pre-run
state makes the same kind of copy, over the original and under the repeat
number it already had, because a run that failed is not another execution.

**Completion removes a row; deletion depends on whether BLACS is running it.**
A shot that completed leaves the queue and is forwarded to lyse. Every other
outcome — ``aborted``, ``failed`` or ``rejected`` — leaves the row, red, at the
head of the queue and records the reason BLACS gave in its tooltip. After
``aborted`` or ``failed``, the next request from BLACS is
offered that same row, under the same identifier: retry is the default, and
deleting the row is the only way to discard it. There is no Retry/Drop policy
any more; the operator's choice is between asking for shots again and deleting
the row.

``rejected`` is the exception, and it is worth being clear about why. It means
BLACS could not read the shot at all — a file that has gone, a connection table
that does not match the apparatus. Nothing about the apparatus is wrong and
nothing about it will change by asking again, so runmanager holds that row and
stops offering it, and **BLACS does not stop requesting**: it keeps asking,
receives nothing, and runs its local override shot until the row is deleted or a
runmanager restart clears the state. Stopping BLACS for this would need
somebody standing at the apparatus to start it again over a file only
runmanager can put right, which a remote runmanager user cannot do. The one
rejection that does stop BLACS is a local override shot it cannot read: that
file was chosen at the apparatus, there is no queue row to hold it, and the
alternative is retrying an unreadable file once a second.

A shot that never got as far as BLACS is held the same way. With lazy compile,
a queued shot is compiled when BLACS asks for it, and one that fails to compile
goes red at the head with the reason rather than being dropped — a row
disappearing looks exactly like the queue draining normally, which is what a
labscript file that cannot compile used to produce. That row is the one kind
that is *not* retried: a compile that fails partway leaves data in the shot
file that stops labscript ever compiling into it, so only deleting it, which
takes the half-written file with it, moves the queue on.

**A row still marked running is offered again.** If an offer reply never
reaches BLACS, or BLACS restarts while holding the shot, the row would
otherwise sit marked running for ever with the whole queue stopped behind it.
Runmanager hands it out again instead. The inference that licenses this spans
both applications: BLACS is sequential, asks for a shot only when it is idle,
and carries the outcome of the shot it has just finished on the same exchange.
So a request that arrives without an outcome retiring this row proves BLACS is
not running it. **Asking runmanager for work from anywhere other than the shot
loop, or while a shot is under way, breaks that inference and would have one
shot handed out twice.** The rule holds for one BLACS per runmanager, which is
what this protocol is written for; a second BLACS asking the same runmanager
would be given the row the first is still executing.

**Repeating an exchange is safe, and errors are answered rather than raised.**
BLACS lets go of an outcome only once runmanager has taken it, so a lost reply
makes it send the same outcome again. A completion for a row that has already
gone changes nothing in the queue, and lyse skips a file it already has; a
failure for a row already carrying that same reason changes nothing and is not
reported twice. This deduplication applies while that failed state remains;
after the row is reoffered, another failure is a real outcome and must be
processed. A completed shot matching no row is still passed to lyse: runmanager
cannot tell a resent completion from a shot whose row went while BLACS ran it,
as across a runmanager restart, so it passes the shot on rather than risk
losing a real result, and says so in its output box. An outcome runmanager
cannot read, and any failure on
runmanager's side while it chooses what to offer, are likewise reported in its
output box, and the exchange still answers normally.
Raised, they would reach BLACS as an error indistinguishable from never having
reached runmanager at all, so BLACS would hold an outcome it had already
delivered and resend it once a second indefinitely.

**Paths cross the boundary in shared-drive-agnostic form.** Runmanager sends
agnostic paths; BLACS converts them to local paths before opening anything, and
sends agnostic paths back in outcomes and in its status. Both sides must agree
on the ``shared_drive`` prefix in their labconfig. If they disagree, the shot
runmanager offers names a file BLACS cannot open, so BLACS rejects it, keeps
requesting shots and says so, and the row goes red in runmanager with that
reason — the same path any unusable shot takes. That queued shot does not run;
if configured, BLACS runs its local override shot while the path configuration
is corrected.

Four controls, four owners
--------------------------

Three separate controls now govern whether a shot runs, and a fourth interrupts
one that already is. A queue that is not moving is nearly always one of them,
so they are worth telling apart.

**Pause queue** (runmanager, Queue tab) stops *this* runmanager offering work —
both queued rows and the default shot it would otherwise generate. It does not
stop BLACS. The shot already under way finishes normally, and BLACS goes on
running its local override shot while the queue is paused, exactly as it does
for a runmanager with an empty queue. The queue itself is untouched, so
resuming offers the same shot at its head. Pause is saved and restored with the
queue configuration; a configuration written before the control existed opens
with the queue running rather than silently stopped.

**Request shots** (BLACS) is the gate on hardware execution, and the only one.
It always starts unchecked and is deliberately not part of BLACS's saved state,
so enabling execution is always a deliberate act at this apparatus rather than
something a restart resumes. Unchecking it stops the next request, not the shot
in hand: a whole shot happens within one pass of the shot loop, so it finishes
first. An outcome still waiting to be reported is not held back by it either,
so runmanager always learns how the shot it offered turned out. Aborted
and failed outcomes uncheck it and record why. A rejected runmanager shot
leaves it checked because the apparatus is sound; a rejected local override
shot unchecks it because there is no runmanager row to hold the unreadable
file. Re-checking after a latched outcome is how an operator acknowledges that
error and asks again — one action, deliberately
checking nothing first, because the per-device check made when the next shot is
programmed is still the final authority and will stop requests again if the
problem is still there.

**BLACS** (runmanager, the destination checkbox beside Engage) decides only
whether the shots Engage compiles are put into the runmanager queue. Unticked,
they are compiled and left alone. It is not a pause, it does not reach BLACS at
all, and the shots already in the queue are unaffected by it. Its remote
methods are still called ``get_run_shots``/``set_run_shots``, from when the
checkbox was labelled *Run shot(s)*; only the label changed. The status
indicator beside it is a separate thing and stays live whatever the checkbox
says.

**Abort** (BLACS) is the only way to interrupt a shot that is running. It
belongs to the operator at the apparatus and nothing runmanager sends can reach
it. Aborting reports the shot as ``aborted``, so its row goes red and is
retried when requests are enabled again; like a failed outcome it unchecks
**Request shots**.

The queue while a shot is running
---------------------------------

The row BLACS is executing stays in the queue, so the operator can see which
queued item is on the hardware. It is set apart while it is there: the queue's
first row is reserved for whichever shot has been sent to BLACS, ruled off from
the work waiting below it. Running is simply what that row looks like — being
above the rule is what says BLACS was given the shot, so it needs no colour of
its own. One colour is used, for the one case that is an exception: the row
turns red once the shot has come back without running, and is waiting for an
operator. A shot that never compiled is red too, but below the rule with the
waiting work, because it never went to BLACS: the reserved row says what the
apparatus was given, and a file that failed to compile in runmanager was not. It is a row rather than a caption above the table so that
it carries the same columns as everything else, and it is there whether or not
BLACS has a shot, saying so when it does not, so the queue below it never
shifts.

That the row is still in the queue means queue editing can reach it, and the
file must not be taken away: BLACS may be writing into it.

So Delete does not remove that row — it cancels it. The row stays, struck
through, and is never offered again under any circumstance; what clears it is
BLACS's next request carrying no outcome for it, which is the one thing that
proves nobody is running it, and therefore the moment its file is free. That is
the same fact the reclaim rests on. An outcome arriving first clears it too,
whatever the outcome was: the operator has said they do not want this shot, so a
failure does not stay red to be retried, while a completed one is still reported
onward — the cancel is about the queue, not about physics that already happened.

Another Delete cannot remove a cancelled row: it cannot prove the file is free
any more than the first could. The next request with no outcome clears the row;
an outcome arriving first clears it as described above. If BLACS never comes
back, the row stays struck through and inert, because nothing here can safely
delete its file. Ticking *Request shots* lets BLACS make that next request.

Both *Empty queue, then add shots…* submission modes — which clear the queue
before submitting the replacement batch — leave everything that has been sent to
BLACS, failed included, because what they offer is to replace *the queue*, the
work still waiting, and a shot that came back needing attention is not what an
operator meant to discard by submitting different work. Deleting such a row is
still possible and still explicit.

The row BLACS has can be selected, because Delete now does something to it, and
its tooltip says what: that it cancels rather than removes. A cancelled row
cannot be selected again, there being nothing further to aim at it. A selected
row is identified to the queue by its
stable ``shot_id`` rather than by its position, because the queue moves on its
own: a shot finishing removes a row while an operator has one selected, and a
row number that meant one shot when the table was drawn can mean another by the
time the key is pressed. Everything else they were asked to remove is
removed, and runmanager writes one line in its output box saying why the
running shot is still there. Waiting, failed and rejected rows are deletable as
normal — deleting a failed row is the explicit way to discard it, and doing so
exposes the next waiting row without touching BLACS. A replacement
batch is numbered around the running shot rather than over it.

A row can be left marked running when BLACS never came back to report on it —
it was killed mid-shot, or the reply was lost. Delete cancels that row and
retains its file; the next request from BLACS clears it before offering later
work. If it is not cancelled, the next request offers that row again under the
same identifier. If BLACS stays
unavailable, restarting runmanager clears it without losing the queue, because
the running mark is never written to a saved configuration and every restored
row comes back waiting; reloading the saved configuration does the same.

What runmanager can see
-----------------------

Runmanager polls BLACS's existing server for a read-only status snapshot, on
its own background thread, independently of the shot exchange and of whether
the **BLACS** destination checkbox is ticked. BLACS never pushes: runmanager
asks. The snapshot says whether BLACS is requesting shots, what it is currently
doing, the path of the shot it is running and its identifier when that shot
came from a runmanager queue, and the reason it stopped requesting shots if it
has. A path with no identifier is BLACS running its own local override shot,
and runmanager says so. The snapshot is answered without the GUI thread, so a
BLACS busy with a shot still answers.

One snapshot is shown in two places, because it answers two different
questions. Beside the **BLACS** checkbox is a light saying whether BLACS
answered at all: checking, then responding or not responding. It means exactly
what the lyse light on the row below it means and no more — a BLACS sitting
there with **Request shots** unticked, or stopped by a device error, is a
healthy link and shows as responding. Beside **Pause queue** is a line of text
saying what BLACS is doing with the queue: requesting shots, running a named
shot, not requesting shots, or stopped with the reason. That is queue
behaviour rather than link health, it belongs next to the control it is about,
and none of it is a yes or a no that a glyph could carry.

Both are informational only. Apart from answering a ``hello`` ping,
``get_status`` is the only command BLACS's server serves, and that is
deliberate: enabling requests, clearing what stopped them, restarting a device
and aborting a shot all stay with the operator standing at the apparatus. There is an architecture
guard in each repository's test suite that fails if that changes, or if the
superseded request/accept/reject/report calls come back.

Default shots and the local override shot
-----------------------------------------

Two different things run when nobody has queued any work, and only one of them
is lab work.

A **runmanager default shot** is produced by runmanager when its queue is empty
and its *When queue is empty* setting asks for one, from the labscript file
named in its *Default shot* field. It is a shot a runmanager user is running,
so it is materialised as an ordinary queue row with its own stable identifier
and follows every rule above: it is visible in the reserved row while it runs,
goes red with its reason if it does not, is retried after an aborted or failed
outcome, and is held after rejection until deleted or runmanager is restarted.
It can be deleted and is removed and submitted to lyse when it completes. An
aborted or failed default row holds back the next one, because it is the head
of the queue and is what the next request is offered. Default rows are left
out of a saved queue: their
globals were read when they were produced, and their files live in the default
directory for the day they were made.

The **local override shot** is BLACS's own, selected in the BLACS GUI. BLACS
runs it whenever an enabled **Request shots** produced no runmanager shot — the
queue is paused or empty, or runmanager could not be reached or its reply could
not be read — but not while the shot runmanager will offer next is still
compiling, which BLACS waits for instead. It belongs to no runmanager queue, so
its completions are reported to nobody: they reach neither runmanager nor lyse,
which is what keeps repetitions of a shot nobody submitted out of the analysis.
No queue row is created, changed or retired by one — though a runmanager can
still see that BLACS is running one: the activity line beside **Pause queue**
names the shot, and its tooltip says the shot has no identifier and so is a
BLACS local override rather than queued work. Each repetition after the first is written to its own numbered
``_repXXXXX.h5`` file, so no data is overwritten. A
local override shot BLACS cannot run still stops requests and records the
reason, because retrying an unrunnable shot once a second is no answer either —
but there is no runmanager row, so nothing is reported and no row turns red.

How quickly BLACS decides runmanager "could not be reached" is a setting.
Before each exchange it asks runmanager whether it is there and waits
``liveness_timeout`` seconds for an answer — in the ``[timeouts]`` section of
the labconfig, five by default. That question gates the exchange, so an
unreachable runmanager costs the wait once per shot rather than once per status
update: with a local override running through an outage, it is added to every
shot cycle. Lower it if that overhead matters more than tolerating a slow link;
raise it if BLACS treats a merely remote runmanager as absent and runs its
local override shot instead of queued work. BLACS's runmanager light does not
use it: the light asks on its own, every two seconds with a one-second
deadline, so it stays current while requests are off. It is
deliberately not tied to ``communication_timeout``, which is the allowance for
runmanager to choose and prepare a shot: that is work, this is a round trip, and
sizing one from the other would make raising the allowance for a slow compile
quietly slow down noticing that runmanager has gone.

Executing a shot
----------------

Shot execution follows this pattern:

#.  While **Request shots** is checked and BLACS is idle, it exchanges with
    runmanager: reporting the last shot's outcome if it is still holding one,
    and asking for the next shot. If runmanager offers none — paused, empty or
    unreachable — and a local override shot has been selected in the BLACS
    GUI, BLACS runs that instead. If its next shot is still compiling, BLACS
    asks again a second later.
#.  BLACS checks the shot's connection table against the lab connection table.
    A shot that fails this check is reported as ``rejected`` on the next
    exchange and **Request shots** remains checked. Runmanager keeps the row,
    red, at the head of the queue with that reason in its tooltip. It holds the
    rejected row until it is deleted or runmanager is restarted; correcting
    the connection table alone does not reoffer it. By contrast, a rejected
    local override shot stops requests and has no runmanager row to report
    against.
#.  BLACS sends each device tab a message to program its device for
    hardware-timed execution, in the ``start_order`` groups the shot file
    declares. The messages are asynchronous, so every device in a group
    programs in parallel; the next group is not started until the previous one
    has finished. During programming a device tab is in
    ``transition_to_buffered`` mode.
#.  BLACS waits until every device reports that it has entered buffered mode.
    If a device times out, restarts, or reports an error, or the operator
    presses **Abort**, BLACS aborts the shot, returns all devices to manual
    mode, unchecks **Request shots** with the reason, and holds the outcome for
    the next exchange.
#.  Once all devices are ready, BLACS records the current state of the manual
    controls — these usually affect the initial values of the shot — and
    instructs the master pseudoclock to begin executing the programmed
    instructions.
#.  BLACS waits for the master pseudoclock to report that the shot has
    finished. If a device restarts or errors during the run, or the operator
    presses **Abort**, BLACS aborts as above.
#.  BLACS instructs every device tab to transition back to manual mode, in the
    shot's ``stop_order`` groups. Device tabs save their acquired data and
    reprogram the hardware for manual operation. Every tab is transitioned even
    if one of them fails. If anything fails here, BLACS returns the shot file
    to its pre-run state so the shot can be run again, unchecks **Request
    shots**, and holds a ``failed`` outcome for the next exchange. A device
    reporting an error after the run and a failure saving the data are
    distinguished in the reason, because they need different attention.
#.  The outcome — ``completed`` or otherwise — is held until the next exchange,
    and is only let go of once runmanager has taken it, so a momentary outage
    cannot lose one. Runmanager, not BLACS, submits completed shots to lyse.

If BLACS is closed while holding an outcome it never delivered, that shot is
named in the log at warning level. The row is not stranded — the next BLACS to
ask that runmanager for work is offered it again under the same identifier —
but this particular run of it reached neither runmanager nor lyse and will be
run again.
