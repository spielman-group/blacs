"""The runmanager/BLACS shot exchange, with both real implementations talking.

Each repository's own tests stand in for the other side, so neither can catch
the two halves drifting apart. Here both run in one process: a real
``RunmanagerServer`` and ``BlacsServer`` on free local ports, reached by the
real ``RunmanagerClient`` and ``BlacsClient``, over ``RunManager``'s real
exchange methods and ``QueueManager`` and ``ShotExecutor``'s real shot loop.
What is faked is what cannot run in a test: runmanager's startup, whose
exchange methods are borrowed onto a plain object, and the apparatus -- the
connection table check and the device tabs, which ``process_request`` and a
tabless ``BLACS`` stand in for so that a whole shot can happen without hardware.
