"""Stand-ins shared by BLACS's tests.

``FakeUi`` is the schema of ``main.ui``'s widget names written down in Python.
It used to be written down in more than one test file, which meant a widget
could be renamed, one copy fixed, and the other left describing a window that
no longer exists -- with the suite still green. That is the one thing a
stand-in for the UI must not do, so there is one copy of it here.

``make_executor`` is here for the same reason. A field added to
``ShotExecutor`` had to be added by hand to each place a test built one, and
missing the second showed up not as a failing test but as a status server that
appeared to be offline, because the snapshot raised on the attribute that was
not there.

The two callers do not need the same executor, so this builds the plain one and
returns it for the caller to add to. What it must not do is leave a field out.

    ``blacs/__main__.py`` builds a ``Splash`` and calls ``show()`` at module

    importing the module puts the startup banner on the screen of whoever is
    running the tests and leaves it there, because nothing in a test run
    reaches the line that takes it down.

    Standing in for the splash module before the import is what avoids that,
    and it avoids it completely: ``Splash.__init__`` is also what creates the
    ``QApplication``, so with this in place the import creates no Qt
    application at all rather than a hidden one. The one the tests need is
    built below, after the import. A test that renders must also ``show()`` its
    window, as ``test_main_window_layout.py`` does, because Qt does not lay out
    a widget that was never shown.
