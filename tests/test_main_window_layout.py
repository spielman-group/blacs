"""How BLACS's main window divides its space.

The shot controls are a fixed strip: two buttons, a status line and the local
override selector. They belong above the device tabs, taking the height they
need and no more. They used to be one half of a vertical splitter, which gave
them a drag handle, let them be sized to anything, and -- because splitter
positions are saved with the front panel -- brought whatever they had last been
dragged to back on every start.

Asserted against the loaded window rather than main.ui read as text: what an
operator meets is the window Qt builds, and a main.ui that will not load is a
BLACS that will not start.
