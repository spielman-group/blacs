# How long to wait for runmanager to answer "are you there". This gates every
# exchange, so it is not a background poll: the shot loop reaches it once per
# shot, which means an unreachable runmanager costs this much between every
# locally-run override shot, not merely between status updates.
#
# The two ways of getting it wrong are not symmetric. Too short and a
# runmanager that is merely remote is judged absent, so BLACS silently stops
# taking queued work while the apparatus quietly runs its own shots -- wrong,
# and easy to miss, because the runmanager light polls on its own and can
# still show runmanager answering. Too
# long and an absent runmanager adds this to every shot cycle as dead time, on
# an apparatus that is otherwise running perfectly well -- visible, and costing
# time rather than data. So err long. A trivial round trip is well under a
# millisecond on a LAN and a few hundred at worst across a campus VPN, which
# leaves five seconds a wide margin; a site running short override shots
# through an outage can lower it.
#
# Deliberately not derived from communication_timeout. That one allows
# runmanager to choose and prepare a shot, which is work; this one measures a
# network round trip. Tying them would make raising the allowance for a slow
# compile silently slow down noticing that runmanager has gone.
